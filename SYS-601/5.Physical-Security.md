###  Physical Security Design and Implementation 

**1. Data Center Protection**

Environmental Controls
* Expanded Envelope : between 64.4 F and 80.6 F
* High Humidity : leads to condensation that may damage electronic equipment 
* Low humidity : Leads to static electricity that may damage electronic equipment 
* Dew Point Range : between 41.9 F and 50 F 
* Servers draw cool air in the front and expel hot air out the back 
* The hot aisle/cold aisle approach makes cooling data centers more efficient 
* Fire Extinguishers 
    - Class A : Common combustibles(wood, cloth, and trash)
    - Class B : Flammable liquids (gasoline and oil)
    - Class C : Electrical fires (data centers)
    - Class D : Heavy metal fires (industrial applications)
    - Class K : Kitchen fires (fats and oils)

**Be able to identify  the classes of fire extinguishers**

* Building-wide suppression systems 
* Wet pipe approach : contain water in the pipes ready to deploy when  a fire strikes 
* Dry pipe approach : do not contain water until a valve opens during a fire alarm 
* Moiture sensors and Electromagnetic interference 
    - Generated by all electronic equipment 
    - Interferes with normal operation of other equipment
    - Enables eavesdropping attacks 
* Faraday cages protect against electromagnetic interference 

Physical Access Control 
* Cipher locks require the user to enter the correct combination 
* Biometric locks use a physical characteristic of a person to permit access 
* Card reader locks require that the user present a magnetic stripe or proximity access card 
* Facility Monitoring 
    - Motion detection 
    - Noise Detection 
* Industrial camouflage seeks to hide sensitive facilities in nondescript locations 

Visitor Management 
* Visitor Procedures 
    - describe allowable visit purposes 
    - explain visit approval authority 
    - describe requirements for unescorted access
    - explain role of visitor escorts 

Physical Security Personnel 
* Robot sentries for security patrols 
* Two-person Integrity 
    - Two people must enter sensitive areas together 
* Two-person control 
    - Two people must jointly approve sensitive actions
