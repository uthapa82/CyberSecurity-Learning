### Identity and Access Management Design and Implementation 

**1.Identification**
* Identification, Authentication, Authoriationa and Accounting 
    - Identification and authentication are separate and distinct steps 
    - Accounting: tracks user activity 

* Usernames and access cards
    - Magnetic stripe cards, Smarts Cards 
    - Card Readers and Proximity Cards 
    
* Biometrics 
    - Somthing you are 
    - good biometric systems provide 
        - Easy enrollment 
        - low false acceptance rates 
        - low false rejection rates 
        - low intrusiveness 
    
    - Fingerprint scans 
        - allow self-enrollment 
        - low false and rejection rates 
    
    - Eye Scans 
        - Analyze color patterns of iris 
        - Analyze blood vessels of retina 
        - Seen as highly intrusive by users 
    
    - Voiceprint matching 
        - requires user to speak a phrase 
        - subject to replay attacks
        - often combined with other authentication techniques 

    - Facial recognition 
        - improving error rates 
    
    - Vein analysis, hand geometry analysis and gait analysis 

*Q1. During the "Authentication" phase of the access control process a user prove his or her identity*
