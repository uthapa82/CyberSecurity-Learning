#### Domain 3 
### Cryptography Design and Implementation 

**1. Encryption**
* Protects sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure 
* Cryptography: The use of mathematical algorithms to transform information into an encrypted form that is not readable by unauthorized individuals 
* Encryption : converts information from plaintext form into ciphertext 
* Decryption: Converts ciphertext messages back into their plaintext form 
* Symmetric Encryption : Encryption and decryption use the same secret key 
    
* Asymmetric Encryption: Encryption and decryption use different keys from the same pair 

* Goal of Cryptography 
    1. Confidentiality : No unauthorized access 
        - Data at Rest : stored on a hard drive or other storage 
        - Data in Transit : Transmitted over a network connection 
        - Data in Use : Processed actively in memory 

    2. Integrity : No unauthorized changes 
    
    3. Authentication : Proof of identity claims 

    4. Obfuscation : Hiding sensitive data 

    5. Non-Repudiation : Verification of Origin
        - Digital Signature provides non-repudiation 
        - Non-repudiation is only possible with asymmetric cryptography 

    - Cryptography involves a tradeoff between security strength and resource consumpution 

* Codes and ciphers 
    - Code: A system that substitutes one word or phrase for another 
    
    ![10-code](images/10-code.png)

    - Stream Cipher : Operate on one character or bit of a message at a time 
    - Block Cipher : Operate on large segments of the message at the same time 
    - Substitution cipher : Change the Characters in a message 
    - Transposition Cipher : Rearrange the character in a message 

* Cryptographic math 
    - Exclusive or (XOR)
    - Confusion: Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key 
    - Diffusion: Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits 
    - Obfuscation: Uses cyptography to hide source code from users 

* Encryption Algorithms 
    - Security through Obscurity: Security of an algorithm depend upon the secrecy of its approach  
    - Longer the key the more secure data it would be but the longer the key the slower the performance would be 

* The perfection encryption algorithm
    - One-Time Pad :unbreakable encryption algorithm
        - Sender and receiver have identical pads 
        - Key is at least as long as the message 
        - Unbreakable because they are totally random 

* The Cryptographic Lifecycle 
    - manages the use of encryption materials over time 
    - As cryptographic algorithms age, they often become insecure 
    
    **5 Stage cryptgoraphic lifecycle**
    1. Initiation
        - Gather requirements for the new cryptographic system 

    2. Development and Acquistion 
        - Find an appropriate combination of hardware, software, and algorithms that meet objectives 

    3. Implementation and Assessment
        - Configure and test the cryptographic system 

    4. Operations and maintenance
        - Ensure the continued secure operation of the cryptographic system

    5. Sunset 
        - Phase out the system and destroy/archive keying material 

*Q1. The simplest way to take an existing cipher and make it stronger is to : increase the length of the encryption key*

*Q2. Prove that a message came from the intended sender : Non-repudiation*

*Q3. Cryptographic cipher that rearranges the characters in a message: transposition Cipher*
