        - Service Focus : identify the impact of various threats on a specific service 
* Automating threat intelligence 
    - Automate the blacklisting of IP addresses from threat feeds 
    - Automation may cause disruption so, alert only feature can be enabled initially to determine the possible IP that could be blocked 
    - Combine different threat feeds for more robust filtering 
* Data Enrichment 
    - Automatically supplements incident data 
* Sample Data Enrichment Tasks

* Machine Learning : allows the automated creation of malware signatures 
* Threat hunting 
    - An organized, systematic approach to seeking out indicators of compromise on our networks using expertise and analytic techniques 
    - Begin by establishing a hypothesis 
    - Indicator of Compromise 
        - Unusual binary files 
        - Unexpected processes or resource consumption
        - Deviation in network traffic 
        - Unexplained log entries 
        - Unapproved configuration changes 
    - After discovering a compromise move into incident response

    3. place the malware on the compromised website
    4. Sit back and wait for infected systems to phone home 

* Shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, tailgating, 

*Q1. What type of website does the attacker use when waging a watering hole attack ? => Site trusted by the end user*

**5. Common Attacks**
* Password attacks  
    - /etc/passwd: password file in linux
    - /etc/shadow: Shadow file can only be accesed by superuser 
    - hash function: mathematical function that converts a variable-length input into a fixed-length output 
        - must produce a completely different output for each input 
        - must be computationally difficult to retrieve the input from the output 
        - must be computationally difficult to find two different inputs that generate the same output (collision)

    - **The Birthday Problem**

    - Compliance risk : potential violations of laws or regulations 

* Supply Chain vulnerabilities 
    - End of Life announcement
    1. End-of-sale : product will no longer be offered for purchase but the vendor will support existing customers 
    2. End-of-support : vendor will reduce or eliminate support for existing users of the product 
    3. End-of-life : the vendor will no longer provide any support or updates for the product 

* Configuration vulnerabilities 
    - defaults passwords, or  unsecured root accounts 
    - cryptographic vulnerabilities 
        - weak cipher suites 
        - weak cryptographic protocol implementations

* Architectural vulnerabilities 
    - IT architecture: processes and practices used to design system 
    - Incorporate Security early, avoid bolt-on security requirements 
    - System Sprawl: new devices are connected to a network, but old devices are not promptly disconnected, leading to security vulnerabilities 
    - System sprawl is even more risky when assets are undocumented 

*Q1. Data breaches violate confidentiality*

**7. Vulnerability Scanning**
* Vulnerability management : detects, remediates and reports vulnerabilities 
    - Linux kernel contains over 24 million lines of code 
    - thousands of lines change everyday 
* Vulnerability Patching Process
    1. the company learns of a vulnerability 
    2. developers analyze the issue and develop a patch 
    3. the company releases the patch to customers 
    4. Customers apply the patch to remediate the vulnerability 
* Why manage vulnerabilities ? 
    - Maintain system security 
    - comply with corporate policy 
    - comply with regulatory requirements 
    - **PCI DSS Requirements**
        - conduct quartely internal and external vulnerability scans 
        - repeat scans after any significant change 
        - use an approved scanning vendor (ASV)
        - remediate and rescan until you achieve a clean report 
    - **FISMA Requirements**
        - Conduct vulnerability scans regularly 
        - Analyze the results of scans 
        - Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities 
        - Share information with other agencies 
* Network Vulnerability Scans 
* Application Scans 
* Web Application Scans 
* Supplement vulnerability scans with configurations and log reviews (for false positives)
* Asset inventory : provides the starting point for vulnerability scanning 
* **Nessus**, **Qualys** 
* Impact, what is the highest data classification handled by the system 
* Likelihood, what is the network exposure , what services are exposed 
* Criticality : what impact does the system have on business operations ? 
* Network location affects scan results 
* Firewall settings, IDS/IPS rules and network segmentation all impact scan results 
* Agent-based scanning: installs software on each target device 
* Credentialed Scanning : uses password to log into system 
* Severe, Critical, Urgent 
* SCAP - Security Content Automation Protocol 
    - SCAP components

    |Pivot| Persistence|
    |-----|-----|
    | After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers use that system as a base from which to target other systems on the same local network| After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers install tools on that system to allow future access- even if the initial vulnerability is corrected | 

* Clean up at the end of the test 

* Bug Bounty 
    - Open Security testing 
    - self-managed and fully-managed bounty programs 

* Cybersecurity exercises may use competitive format 
    - identify vulnerabilities in system 
    - provide participants with hands-on experience attacking and securing system

* Purple Team
    - Combines knowledge from the red and the blue team during a lessons-learned session after the exercise 
* Setting up a sandbox environment for cybersecurity exercises limits the risk to production systems
