### Domain 2
### Secure Code Design and Implementation 

**1. Software Development Lifecycle**
* Software platform
    - Endpoint Applications : self-contained on a device 
    - Client/Server Apps : Interact with a server 
        - Database driven application 
        - Web Applications 
    - Mobile endpoints 
    - Embedded devices power the IoT 
* Development Methodologies 
    - must incorporate security at every steps 
    - business requirements and translate them into a design 
    - Waterfall Model 
        - system requirements -> software requirements -> Preliminary Design -> Detailed Design -> Code and Debug -> Testing -> Operations and Maintenance 
        
    - Sprial Model
        - Begin -> Determine Requirements -> Risk Assessment -> Development and Testing  
    
    - Manifesto for Agile Software Development 
    
* Maturity Models  
    - Provide standard benchmarks 
    - The Capability Maturity Model Integration(CMMI) assesses an organization's process maturity 
        1. Initial
        * Work gets done but is subject to delays and budget overruns 
        
        2. Managed
        * Configuration Management 
        * Measurment and analysis 
        * Project monitoring and control
        * Project planning 
        * Process and product quality assurance 
        * Requirement management 
        * Supplier agreement management 

        3. Defined
        * Decision analysis and resolution 
        * Integrated project management
        * Organizational process definition 
        * Organizational training 
        * Organizational process focus 
        * Product Integration 
        * Requirements development  
        * Risk Management 
        * Technical Solution 
        * Validation 
        * Verification 

        4. Quantitatively Managed 
        * Organizational process performance 
        * Quantitative project management 

        5. Optimizing 
        * Causal analysis and resolution
        * Organizational performance management 

    - IDEAL Model 
        - Initiating Diagnosing Establishing Action Learning 

* Change Management 
    - Request Control
        - Manages, evaluates and prioritizes inbound requests from customers 

    - Change Control
        - Grants permission for developers to make changes to application code 

    - Release Control 
        - Moves the code from the develpment environment into production

    - Code Environments 
        - Development Environment  ---> Test Environment  ---> Staging Environment --> Production Environment 

* Automation and DevOps 
    - DevOps Goals 
        - Build collaborative relationships 
        - Embrace automation 
        - Facilitate rapid release of code 
    - DevOps and Agile are related: both seek continuous integration 
    - Infrastructure as Code : Scripts the creation of resources 
    - Advantages 
        - Increases scalability of environments 
        - Reduces user error 
        - Facilitates testing of new code 
    - DevOps facilitates security automation 

*DecSecOps applies DevOps techniques to a cybersecurity program*

    * DevOps Tools 
        - Continuous validation 
        - Continuous Integration 
        - Continuous delivery 
        - Continuous deployment 
        - Continuous monitoring 

*Q1. What phase of the capability maturity model introduces the reuse of code across projects? => Managed*

*Q2. What component of a change management program includes final testing that the software functions properly? => Release Management*
