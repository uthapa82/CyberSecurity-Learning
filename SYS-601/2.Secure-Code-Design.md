    - Client/Server Apps : Interact with a server 
        - Database driven application 
        - Web Applications 
    - Mobile endpoints 
    - Embedded devices power the IoT 
* Development Methodologies 
    - must incorporate security at every steps 
    - business requirements and translate them into a design 
    - Waterfall Model 
        - system requirements -> software requirements -> Preliminary Design -> Detailed Design -> Code and Debug -> Testing -> Operations and Maintenance 
        
    - Sprial Model
        - Begin -> Determine Requirements -> Risk Assessment -> Development and Testing  
    
    - Manifesto for Agile Software Development 
    
* Maturity Models  
    - Provide standard benchmarks 
    - The Capability Maturity Model Integration(CMMI) assesses an organization's process maturity 
        1. Initial
        * Work gets done but is subject to delays and budget overruns 
        
        2. Managed
        * Configuration Management 
        * Measurment and analysis 
        * Project monitoring and control
        * Project planning 
        * Process and product quality assurance 
        * Requirement management 
        * Supplier agreement management 

        3. Defined
        * Decision analysis and resolution 
        * Integrated project management
        * Organizational process definition 
        * Organizational training 
        * Organizational process focus 
        * Product Integration 
        * Requirements development  
        * Risk Management 
        * Technical Solution 
        * Validation 
        * Verification 

        4. Quantitatively Managed 
        * Organizational process performance 
        * Quantitative project management 

        5. Optimizing 
        * Causal analysis and resolution
        * Organizational performance management 

    - IDEAL Model 
        - Initiating Diagnosing Establishing Action Learning 

* Change Management 
    - Request Control
        - Manages, evaluates and prioritizes inbound requests from customers 

    - Change Control
        - Grants permission for developers to make changes to application code 

    - Release Control 
        - Moves the code from the develpment environment into production

    - Code Environments 
        - Development Environment  ---> Test Environment  ---> Staging Environment --> Production Environment 

* Automation and DevOps 
    - DevOps Goals 
        - Build collaborative relationships 
        - Embrace automation 
        - Facilitate rapid release of code 
    - DevOps and Agile are related: both seek continuous integration 
    - Infrastructure as Code : Scripts the creation of resources 
    - Advantages 
        - Increases scalability of environments 
        - Reduces user error 
        - Facilitates testing of new code 
    - DevOps facilitates security automation 

    - DevOps Tools 
        - Continuous validation 
        - Continuous Integration 
        - Continuous delivery 
        - Continuous deployment 
        - Continuous monitoring 

*DecSecOps applies DevOps techniques to a cybersecurity program*

*Q1. What phase of the capability maturity model introduces the reuse of code across projects? => Managed*

*Q2. What component of a change management program includes final testing that the software functions properly? => Release Management*

**2. Software Quality Assurance**
* Software is one of the most common sources of security vulnerabilities 
* Code Review : use peer analysis to assess code 
* Fagan inspection
    - Planning, overview, preparation, meeting, rework, follow-up
* Verification and validation 
    - Software model validation : Are we building the right software ? 
    - Software verification : Are we bulding the software right ?
* Stress testing 
    - uses automated scripts to verify system capacity 
    - may be run internally or through a vendor 
    - verifies the system can handle the maximum expected load 
    - determines the maximum capacity of the system 
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
    - Ensures software will woirk for users 
    - UAT is commonly referred to as beta testing 
* Regression Testing 
    - checks for unexpected side effects 
* Code security testing checks software for application security flaws 
* Code Security Tests : use technology to inspect software 

|Static Tests | Dynamic Tests | 
|------|-------|
| Use automated techniques to analyze code for errors and security flaws without actually executing it | Execute code to verify that it is functioning correctly and doesn't have security flaws |

* Sythentic transactions supply inputs to code with known, expected outputs 

*Code reviews, static testing and dynamic testing are complementary rather then competitors*

* Fuzzing : Software testing technique that feeds software many different input values in an attempt to cause an unpredictable state or unauthorized access 
* Fuzz testing input sources 
    - Developer-supplied input
    - Developer-supplied script 
    - Generation fuzzing 
    - Mutation fuzzing 

**OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)**

* Avoid looking like a hacker : Only fuzz test with permission 
* Code repositories
    - store software source code files 
    - coordinate changes among multiple developers 
    - perform version control 
    - promote code reuse 
* code repositories help to avoid dead code 

* Secure provisioning and deprovisioning of applications ensures the integrity of released code 
* Integrity Measurement : verifies release code is unchanged using hash value 
* Application Control : Restricts software that may run 

|Whitelisting | Blacklisting|
|-----|------|
|Administrators create a list of all the application that may run on a system | Administrators create a list of the applications that are prohibited on a system | 

* Windows GPL (Group Policy Management)
    - Application Control Policies 
        - Executable Rules 
        - Windows Installer Rules 
        - Script Rules 
        - Packaged app Rules 

* Integrate application control logs with your SIEM 
* Host Software Baselining : identifies expected system software 
* Third-party libraries 
* Software Development Kits (SDKS) : provide programming resources 
* Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

*Q1. What type of fuzz testing captures real software input and modifies it? => Mutation fuzzing*
*Q2. What is the name of the application control technology built-in to Microsoft Windows? => AppLocker*
*Q3. Libraries consist of shared code objects that perform related functions*
*Q4. What is the first step of a Fagan inspection? => Planning*
