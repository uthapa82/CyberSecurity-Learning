### Security Awareness Training 
#### 1. Importance of Security
* Security Components : People, Process, Technology 
* People are the first and last line of defense from attackers.
* Good Cyber Security etiquette 
* More Resistance----> Hacking  vs Least Resistance-----> Social Engineering  
* Good Guy = White hat ---> Hackers who test security for non-malicious reasons and have consent to perfom hacking 
* Bad Guy = Black Hat ----> Hackers with malicous motivation

    * Financial Gain : hack financial system or hold data hostage 
    * Espionage :corporation or governments 
        * Exploit critical systems
        * Exploit social networks 
        * Spread misinformation 

    * Fun, Ideology, resentment

        * Revenge 

    * Insider 
        * Personal gain or Revenge 
        * Example : current  employee who exposes sensitive data, exploits vulnerabilities 
        * steals intellectual property 

* Grey Hat ---> Hackers who may violate law or ethical standards, but do not
have a malicious intent

* Hackers 
    * Pay to display malicious ads
    * Buy web addresses that are typed incorrectly 
    * Clone users favorite websites to steal username and passwords 
    * Solicit users to download software under false promises 
    * Apps like slack, skype, jira etc can be used by hackers to impersonate someone we may know or create a sense of urgency 

* User Rights 
    * Hackers will take advantage of people's access and system permissions 

#### 2. Data and Account Security
* Data is a collection of information, facts, recorded observations, and/or statistics collected together for analysis or planning 
* Information is King 
* Data Collection must meet with the compliance 

* Securiry is  Top Priority 
    * Training new Staff members 
    * Purchasing a new security system 
    * Installing new software 

* Data Organization, Roles and Responsibilities, Risk level, Data lifecycles, safeguard 

* Credential : Pairing of a user's account ID and a known secret 
* Authentication : The activity by which someone validates their identity, prove the system that you are who you say you are 
    * Something you know such as password/secret 
    * something you have such as token or badge 
    * Something you are such as fingerpring or void signature 

* Authorization:  The access granted to an account on a system to perform a specific task or function 

* Account Privilege:  A account with elevated aaccess to sensitive information 

* Multi-Factor Authentication: Uses two or more factors 
    * users are required to provide two or more independent credentials before they are allowed access to a network or system 
    * Something you know, something you have, something you are 

* Single sign-on: SSO is centralized access control method, that allows the user to authenticate once and gain access to multiple resources that they have rights to without having to authenticate again 
    * Is concenient 
    * Increases security 
    * Reduces the number of required accounts, eases account administration tasks 

* **Corporate Data Policies**
    * Use, Handling, Marking 
        * Roles and Responsibilities 
        * Access, Retrieval, Storage, Retention, Backup, Destruction

* Data Governance Policies are  to :
1. Establish clear lines of accountability and ownership 
2. Define procedures and best practices 
3. Protect data confidentiality from internal and external threats 
4. Ensure compliance with applicable standards, regulations and laws 
5. Establish accounting and audit trail for access to data 
6. Create data marking and handling procedures for different data classifications 

* Data  roles and responsibilities 
    * Data owner, Data custodian, Data producers, Data consumers, Data steward 
    * Data owner accountable for an overall data set 

    * Data Steward : manages the data from day to day , 
        * overseers of the data 
        * manage data quality 
        * manage rules
        * manage definitions 
        * manage integrity 
        * manage proper data entry 
        * Reports to data owners 

    * Data Custodian: Control access to the data 
        * safeguard, audit and maintain the integrity of the data 
        * Usually performed by someone in IT 
        * Responsible for backing up, transporting and storing data 

    * Data Producers : Create and capture data 
        * follow the rules set by the data owner 
        * produce data that meets the consumer's needs 

    * Data consumers : Make use of the data , data has to be the right quality for them to perform their role 

* **Data Classification** 
    * based on value and sensitivity 
    * classifying based in terms of Risk
        * sensitive , secret, confidential, proprietary, public 
    * High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk 

    * High Risk : information that would have severe impacts if it is disclosed 
        * sensitive , confidential, secret 
        * example , financial records, PII( Personally Identifiable Information), Account names and passwords, Regulated data 
    
    * Medium Risk : information that would cause less harm if it is disclosed 
        * Restricted, internal, protected 
        * example: contracts, sales numbers, budgets
    
    * Low Risk: information that can be given to any individual or distributed internally or externally with minimal or no risk
        * Public, declassified, not restricted 
        * example : marketing materials,job posting,  customer policies, product offerings 

* **How where and what we're accessing all have impact on data security**
* How to assist in improving your organization's data security ?
    1. Properly classify data and know the rules for use 
    2. Be aware of your surroundings when sensitive documents are open 
    3. Immediately notifty staff if a device with data is lost 
    4. Take precautions to secure your data when working remotely 
    5. Do not leave devices containing data exposed 
    6. Only transfer data via business provided or approved secure transfer systems 
    7. Do not place sensitive data on removable devices (make sure it's encrypted)
    8. Research the encryption laws and regulations if you travel internationally 

* Data lifecycle 
    * creating data, consuming data, presenting data 
    * **Gather the data, transform it into something useful, present and interpret your data, maintain and protect your data, and securely archieve or delete the data**
    
* User accounts are most fundamental component for protecting data 
    * Foundational and critical 
    * Don't allow personal details such as your phone number and email address to be viewed publicly 
    * Restrict access to your friends only

    * Limit use of social media to personal topics rather than writing about work issues 
* **Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data**
